                    <h3>Terms & Conditions</h3>
                    <p>
                        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make
                        sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy,
                        or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to
                        attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app
                        into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks,
                        copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong
                        to 321 Fetch.

                        321 Fetch is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
                        possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
                        services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
                        without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

                        Our apps store and process personal data that you have provided to us, in order to
                        provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
                        secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
                        process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
                        system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
                        programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that our apps
                        won’t work properly or at all.

                        You should be aware that there are certain things that 321 Fetch will not take
                        responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider,
                        but 321 Fetch cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance
                        left.

                        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of
                        the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be
                        charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
                        accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                        responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside
                        of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
                        not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume
                        that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

                        Along the same lines, 321 Fetch cannot always take responsibility for the way
                        you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                        battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, 321 Fetch cannot accept
                        responsibility.

                        With respect to 321 Fetch’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re
                        using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so
                        that we can make it available to you. 321 Fetch accepts no liability for any
                        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of
                        the app.

                        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on – the
                        requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of
                        the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
                        app. 321 Fetch does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is
                        relevant to you and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device. However,
                        you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish
                        to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
                        termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
                        licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
                        needed) delete it from your device.
                    </p>
