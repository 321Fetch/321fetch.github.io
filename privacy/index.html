                    <p>
                        321 Fetch is committed to protecting your privacy. We will not distribute your personal information to third parties not
                        affiliated with 321 Fetch without your consent and we do not sell or rent your personal information.
                        This privacy policy explains the guidelines we use in protecting your privacy, which is applicable
                        to the use of fetch321.us and our mobile apps (collectively, the “Services”).

                    <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
                    <p>
                        321 Fetch collects anonymous usage statistics and crash reports through our mobile applications. The usage statistics and
                        crash reports help us diagnose problems, help us understand how users interact with our mobile applications,
                        and help us improve the performance of our mobile applications. This data, along with any other automatic
                        anonymous data we collect is not linked to any personal information you provide. Persistent identifiers
                        may automatically be collected from users, either by 321 Fetch or by a third party on behalf of
                        321 Fetch. Persistent identifiers are used to support the internal operations of our Services, which
                        may include maintaining and analyzing our Services, performing network communications, authenticating
                        users, personalizing content, and protecting the security or integrity of the Services.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Information You Provide</h4>

                        process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect
                        your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
